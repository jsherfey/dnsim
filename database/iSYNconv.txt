# iSYNconv: fast threshold modulation with convergence-based connectivity
# Each postsynaptic neuron receives connections from convval randomly
# chosen presynaptic neurons. Note that we should have convval <= Npre.
# Other than connectivity, everything else is the same as iSYN.txt
# See also: iSYNdiv.txt

# constants
g_SYN=.5; E_SYN=-80; tauDx=1; tauRx=.25; convval = 1;
IC=.1; IC_noise=0

# precompute linear positions (index)
[dummy,Xpre] = sort(randn(Npre,Npost),1)
Xpost = Xpre
# Xpre stores random values in each column
# Xpost is not used

# compute mask
mask = Xpre <= convval

# gating dynamics
sSYNpre' = -sSYNpre./tauDx + ((1-sSYNpre)/tauRx).*(1+tanh(Vpre/10))

# initial conditions
sSYNpre(0)=IC+IC_noise.*rand(Npre,1)

# synaptic current
ISYNconv(V,s) = (g_SYN.*(s'*mask)'.*(V-E_SYN))

# interface statement
current => -ISYNconv(Vpost,sSYNpre)
