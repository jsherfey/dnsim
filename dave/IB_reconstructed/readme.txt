This folder contains my implementation of the Kramer model, built up from earlier code Jason sent to me. It gets subtly different results than Jason's implementations (Kramer_IB.m and Kramer.m).

There are 3 stages of my implementation:
	IB_connected.mat
	IB_connected2.mat
	IB_connected3.mat


These have corresponding script versions (generated using DNSim)
	ib_connected_script
	ib_connected2_script
	ib_connected3_script



The other .mat files are the original model specs I presume; they are all non-connected.
