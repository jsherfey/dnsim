# A: A-current
# Jasonâ€™s email:
# Here are two different A-type K+ current mechanisms I've implemented.
# However, I have not worked with these much or carefully verified that
# they are working properly. The reference for iAPoirazi.txt is included in
# it; I don't remember where I got the model in iA.txt though.
gA=1; EA=-80;
ainf(V)=1./(1+exp(-(V+60)/8.5))
atau(V)=.37+1./(exp((V+46)/5)+exp(-(V+238)/37.5))
binf(V)=1./(1+exp((V+78)/6))
btau(V)=19+1./(exp((V+46)/5)+exp((V+238)/(-37.5)))
a' = (ainf(V)-a)./atau(V)
b' = (binf(V)-b)./btau(V)
a(0)=zeros(Npop,1)
b(0)=zeros(Npop,1)
# a(0)=rand(Npop,1)
# b(0)=rand(Npop,1)
IA(V,a,b)=gA.*a.^4.*b.*(V-EA)
current => -IA(V,a,b)
